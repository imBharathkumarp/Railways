**Project:** Railway Management System with Advanced Safety Features

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This feature implements an intelligent ticket capping system that prevents dangerous overcrowding while allowing controlled flexibility in general coaches. The system ensures passenger safety by monitoring real-time capacity and blocking bookings when safety limits are reached.

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Logic**

```typescript
// Reserved Coach Booking Logic
if (bookedReservedSeats >= totalReservedSeats) {
    blockFurtherReservation();
}

// General Coach Smart Capping
if (bookedGeneralTickets >= (generalCapacity + allowedOverbooking)) {
    showMessage("Coach Full. Please choose another train or wait.");
}
```

### **Key Parameters**
- **Reserved Coach Capacity:** 72 seats (Hard cap)
- **General Coach Base Capacity:** 100 passengers
- **Allowed Overbooking:** Maximum 50 additional passengers
- **Safety Buffer:** 95% capacity warning threshold

---

## üöÇ **Feature Breakdown**

### **1. Reserved Coach Management**
‚úÖ **Hard Cap Implementation**
- Once 72 seats are booked, no further booking allowed via app/website
- Prevents overbooking completely
- Real-time seat availability tracking
- Integration-ready for IRCTC systems

### **2. General Coach Smart Capping**
‚úÖ **Controlled Overbooking**
- Base capacity: 100 passengers
- Maximum occupancy: 150 passengers (100 + 50 overbooking)
- Beyond 150: "Train Full ‚Äì Please wait or choose another"
- Safety warnings at 95% capacity (142 passengers)

### **3. Real-Time Safety Monitoring**
‚úÖ **Dynamic Status Updates**
- **SAFE:** Below 95% capacity
- **NEARLY_FULL:** 95-100% capacity (warning zone)
- **FULL:** 100-150% capacity (overbooking active)
- **OVERCAPACITY:** Above 150% (booking blocked)

3. **Safety Report Generation:** Automated safety analysis
4. **Visual Dashboard:** Professional capacity visualization

### **For Project Report**
> **"Smart Ticket Management Implementation:**
> Reserved coaches are capped at 72 seats to avoid overbooking. Once seats are filled, further booking is blocked via app or website. For general coaches, real-time seat data allows a maximum of 50 additional passengers after base capacity (100) is reached. This is enforced across UTS app and station counters to prevent dangerous overcrowding."

### **For Methodology Section**
- **Problem Identification:** Overcrowding safety concerns
